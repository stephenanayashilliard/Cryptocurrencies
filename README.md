# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Using unsupervised learning, create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.   Since there is no known output, unsupervised learning using a clustering algorithm is used.  This assignement consists of four analysis deliverables.
- Preproccessing the Data
- Reducing Data Dimensions
- Clustering Crytocurrencies using K-means.
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies
